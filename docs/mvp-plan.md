üìå Next Steps: TikTok Clone Development Roadmap

1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Structure & Setup
‚Ä¢ Refactor AuthService.swift into an AuthViewModel to better integrate with SwiftUI.
‚Ä¢ Create a FirestoreService.swift file to handle interactions with Firestore.
‚Ä¢ Add an AppState.swift file to manage global authentication state.
‚Ä¢ Set up a UserModel.swift to structure user data.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Implement Firestore for Video Storage
‚Ä¢ Create VideoModel.swift with properties:
‚Ä¢ id: String
‚Ä¢ userId: String
‚Ä¢ videoUrl: String
‚Ä¢ caption: String
‚Ä¢ likes: Int
‚Ä¢ comments: [String]
‚Ä¢ timestamp: Date
‚Ä¢ Create a FirestoreService.swift function to upload video metadata to Firestore.
‚Ä¢ Implement a Firestore query in FirestoreService.swift to fetch videos in descending order of upload time.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Video Uploading
‚Ä¢ Install AVFoundation to handle video recording and playback.
‚Ä¢ Create a VideoUploader.swift to:
‚Ä¢ Open the camera picker.
‚Ä¢ Save video to Firebase Storage.
‚Ä¢ Retrieve the video URL and store metadata in Firestore.
‚Ä¢ Update Firestore with the uploaded video information.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Video Playback & Feed
‚Ä¢ Create a VideoFeedView.swift to display a scrolling video feed.
‚Ä¢ Implement VideoPlayerView.swift using AVPlayer for native video playback.
‚Ä¢ Load videos from Firestore dynamically into VideoFeedView.swift.

5Ô∏è‚É£ User Profiles & Authentication
‚Ä¢ Store user information in Firestore after successful signup.
‚Ä¢ Create UserProfileView.swift to display user details and uploaded videos.
‚Ä¢ Implement a ‚ÄúLogout‚Äù button that correctly clears session state.

6Ô∏è‚É£ UI Enhancements
‚Ä¢ Improve the login & signup UI with a better layout.
‚Ä¢ Add a custom loading indicator when videos are fetching.
‚Ä¢ Implement a ‚ÄúLike‚Äù and ‚ÄúComment‚Äù system with Firestore updates.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Testing & Debugging
‚Ä¢ Test authentication flows (signup, login, logout).
‚Ä¢ Test video uploading and playback.
‚Ä¢ Fix potential performance bottlenecks with Firebase queries.

üìå Deployment Milestone (After MVP Completion)
‚Ä¢ Test on a physical device using Firebase App Distribution.
‚Ä¢ Implement basic analytics to track video plays.
‚Ä¢ Prepare for App Store submission (if needed).

üéØ Next Immediate Steps 1. Set up Firestore models and queries. 2. Implement video upload & Firebase Storage integration. 3. Build the scrolling video feed with playback.

üí° Notes for the AI IDE Agent
‚Ä¢ The project will store user-generated videos in Firebase Storage and metadata in Firestore.
‚Ä¢ AuthService.swift should handle authentication logic, but the app should use an observable state model.
‚Ä¢ The video feed should auto-play videos and allow users to scroll infinitely.

This plan gives a clear and actionable roadmap for the AI IDE agent to build upon. üöÄ Let me know if you want to tweak anything!
