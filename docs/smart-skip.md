Below is a comprehensive plan for adding smart skip and filler detection within QuikTok. The idea is to automatically detect filler segments (such as long intros, repetitive banter, or ads) so that the player, or the user, can easily skip over uninteresting parts of a video.

---

## 1. Update the Segmentation Process

### A. Modify the JSON Schema

Update the segmentation JSON schema to include an optional boolean field (e.g., isFiller) that flags filler segments. For example, the updated schema might look like this:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "segments": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "startTime": { "type": "number" },
          "endTime": { "type": "number" },
          "topic": { "type": "string" },
          "summary": { "type": "string" },
          "isFiller": { "type": "boolean" }
        },
        "required": ["startTime", "endTime", "topic", "summary"],
        "additionalProperties": false
      }
    }
  },
  "required": ["segments"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

_Note:_ The new property “isFiller” may not be required for every segment—only those that the model flags as filler will have it set to `true`.

### B. Adjust the GPT‑4o‑mini Prompt

Alter the system prompt for the segmentation API call to instruct the model to identify filler content. For example, modify the prompt to include instructions like:

> "You are a video segmentation AI. Given the full transcript with word-level timestamps, extract major topical segments. In addition, detect any filler or redundant parts (such as long intros, repetitive content, or advertisements) and mark those segments with an 'isFiller' flag (set to true). Return a JSON object following this schema: ..."

Include the modified schema (with the “isFiller” field) in the instructions. This prompts the model to return an output similar to:

```json
{
  "segments": [
    { "startTime": 0, "endTime": 30, "topic": "Introduction", "summary": "Short overview ...", "isFiller": true },
    { "startTime": 30, "endTime": 90, "topic": "Main Content", "summary": "Detailed discussion on X", "isFiller": false }
  ]
}
```

### C. Update Your Cloud Function

Within your existing cloud function (such as in `functions/videoSegmentation.js`), update the segmentation payload in the API call to OpenAI so that it includes the updated JSON schema and prompt. No major structure changes are necessary; simply modify the system prompt and JSON schema block.

---

## 2. Persisting and Updating Data

### A. Firestore Integration

- Ensure that when you update Firestore with the segmentation data, you include the `isFiller` property along with the other segment data.
- If you have any migration or schema versioning concerns, document that segments now may include this extra flag.

### B. Update Your Video Model (Swift)

In your Swift data models (e.g., in `Tiktok/Models/VideoModel.swift`), update the Segment structure to optionally include the new field. For example:

```swift
struct Segment: Codable, Hashable {
    let startTime: Double
    let endTime: Double
    let topic: String
    let summary: String
    let isFiller: Bool? // optional flag; default to nil if not provided
}
```

---

## 3. Enhance the Client-Side UI/UX

### A. Visual Indicators in the Video Player

- **Timeline Markers:**  
  In your progress bar component (e.g., `Tiktok/Views/Components/VideoProgressBar.swift`), adjust the color or opacity of filler segments. For instance, you might render filler segments in a different (perhaps muted or more transparent) color compared to non-filler segments.

- **Overlay Updates:**  
  In views such as `VideoSegmentOverlay.swift`, you can optionally display an indicator (e.g., a “Skip Filler” badge) when the user is scrubbing over a filler segment.

### B. Smart Skip Functionality

Implement logic in the video player (within `Tiktok/Views/VideoContent.swift` or a similar view) to automatically bypass filler segments:

1. **Add a UI Toggle:**  
   Create a toggle control (or button) that enables or disables “Skip Filler” mode. This state variable (for example, `isSkipFillerEnabled`) will control whether the video player should automatically skip filler segments.

2. **Modify Playback Behavior:**  
   In the time observer or scrubbing logic:
   - When `isSkipFillerEnabled` is on and the current playback time falls within a segment flagged as filler (`isFiller == true`), automatically seek to the end of that filler segment.
   - For instance, if the current playback time is within a filler segment, execute code that finds the active filler segment and advances the player to `segment.endTime`.

Example (simplified pseudocode within the periodic observer):

```swift
if isSkipFillerEnabled, let segments = video.segments {
    let currentTime = progress * duration
    if let fillerSegment = segments.first(where: { $0.isFiller == true && currentTime >= $0.startTime && currentTime <= $0.endTime }) {
        // Automatically seek past the filler segment
        let targetTime = fillerSegment.endTime
        let time = CMTime(seconds: targetTime, preferredTimescale: 600)
        player?.seek(to: time, toleranceBefore: .zero, toleranceAfter: .zero)
    }
}
```

### C. Manual Skip Option

- Optionally add a “Skip Filler” button on the player’s controls so that if the user is watching a filler segment, they can tap a button to immediately jump to the end of that segment.

### D. Testing & Edge Cases

- **Test across Various Videos:**  
  Ensure that both long-form podcasts and videos with short fillers are handled correctly.
- **Fallback Behavior:**  
  In instances where segmentation might be inaccurate, consider allowing manual override of skip behavior or displaying a prompt to the user.
- **Error Handling:**  
  Include logs and error handling for cases when the filler attribute is missing or when seeking to a filler segment fails.

## 4. Documentation & Future Enhancements

- **Documentation:**  
  Update your developer and user documentation to explain the new smart skip functionality. Document how filler segments are detected and what users can expect.
- **Future Enhancements:**  
  Consider integrating learning from user interaction (e.g., if many users always skip certain types of segments) to fine-tune which segments are marked as filler. You could also expose an option for users to give feedback on whether a segment was incorrectly marked as filler.

By following this plan, you can leverage your existing segmentation infrastructure and enhance it with filler detection logic. This will enable a more dynamic viewing experience where users can effortlessly skip content they find uninteresting, making long-form media much more engaging and user-friendly in QuikTok.
